### making a pull request

- Access project [repository](https://github.com/UnBCIC-TP2/Oberon-Scala):

- Fork the project. After this, you will see the repository forked at your Github account repositories.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:{{user-name}}/Oberon-Scala.git
```

Example: git clone https://github.com/marcelomamorim/Oberon-Scala

- After cloned to your machine, you can start thinking to add new features, tests and whatever can help
the project to evolve.

- You can try to start creating a new local branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/{{name-your-feature}}
```

- After that, start coding. When you finish your development, commit and push to your forked repository.
- At the end, just open a Pull Request to the project repository. You can do it by the Github UI if you want.
